A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/jmeeker/pen/EwQzgd.

 Inspiration from http://codepen.io/tbwIII/pen/BipEg I left out positioning the ul absolute and its parent relative, which would allow the drop down to layer over any content beneath it, I wanted it to push the content below it down to make room for its drop down.
